                  Greetings, creature of the real world!
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>
                  My name is Stiven Arias Giraldo, and by day (and often night), I'm a freelance game developer and
                  software engineer, working mainly through <a href="https://www.upwork.com/en-gb/freelancers/~018f7e0e1df08439dd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upwork <i className="fa fa-arrow-right" style={{ transform: 'rotate(-45deg)' }}></i></a>, but
                  also reachable on <a href="https://es.linkedin.com/in/stiven-arias-giraldo-9219241b2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn <i className="fa fa-arrow-right" style={{ transform: 'rotate(-45deg)' }}></i></a> or
                  the old-fashioned way via <a href="mailto:starias2797@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">email <i className="fa fa-arrow-right" style={{ transform: 'rotate(-45deg)' }}></i></a>.
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>
                  I earned my bachelor's degree in Video Game Development from Universidad Complutense of Madrid, and have
                  accumulated real-world experience, alongside a variety of personal projects that kept me inspired,
                  caffeinated, and occasionally sleep-deprived.
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>
                  In both academic and professional realms, I've developed a reputation for writing clean, efficient code, tackling
                  complex challenges, and thriving in collaborative environments. I'm passionate about taking initiative, fostering
                  teamwork, and keeping things optimistic, even when the code gets messy.
                  <br></br>

                  I have solid experience that shows I can write high-quality code and solve complex problems. I'm especially
                  skilled in  problem-solving, organizing code structure, and helping manage and coordinate projects.
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>
                  I enjoy working with different kinds of teams, and always bring a positive attitude and strong technical skills to the table.
                  <br></br>
                  <br></br>
                  Efficiency and precision guide the execution of my tasks, whereas larger challenges are addressed by first
                  understanding the overall context and then designing a well-structured plan of action.
